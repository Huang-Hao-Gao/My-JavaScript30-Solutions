Using the data attribute in HTML

Whenever you want to create your own custom attribute, custom in the sense that it isn't 'class' or 'src' etc, you put it in front of 'data-'

e.g.
<div data-key="65" class="key">

This is then linked to the other element:
<audio data-key="65" src="sounds/clap.wav"></audio>




in an addEventListener, you can return within the callback function to exit the function without running the rest of the code
